Detective, you have been assigned your first case. Here are the details.

00:06.680 --> 00:11.350
Alex, a phone design engineer begins his day with zero focus.

00:11.360 --> 00:14.150
He wakes up and immediately grabs his phone,

00:14.160 --> 00:16.830
wasting time scrolling right through breakfast,

00:16.840 --> 00:21.070
he arrives at the office without any plan or priority list.

00:21.080 --> 00:25.030
His workday is a constant cycle of distraction.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.910
Every notification, message and unplanned chat pulls him away from his tasks,

00:30.480 --> 00:33.230
severely cutting his productivity.

00:33.240 --> 00:37.750
Instead of finishing one job, he tries to do five things at once.

00:37.760 --> 00:42.390
He also attends too many meetings, sitting through many where he isn't needed.

00:42.400 --> 00:46.910
When deadlines get close, this chaotic style catches up to him,

00:46.920 --> 00:51.510
leaving him feeling panicked, stressed, and tense.

00:51.520 --> 00:57.670
Your job is to investigate and fix Alex's time management issues.

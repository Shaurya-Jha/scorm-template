00:00.160 --> 00:04.550
Detective, we've got a priority collapse in sector grid 12.

00:04.560 --> 00:08.510
Someone's daily schedule detonated into absolute chaos.

00:08.520 --> 00:15.670
Our subject is Mia Rix, software lead, bright mind, terrible prioritizer.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.390
She spent 30 minutes choosing a VR filter for her

00:18.400 --> 00:23.350
personal trip and zero minutes preparing tomorrow's client report.

00:23.360 --> 00:25.470
She attended all team meetings,

00:25.480 --> 00:29.910
even the ones where her presence meant nothing, and apparently she spent half her lunch.

00:30.240 --> 00:35.430
assembling a bento drone instead of finishing her backlog deliverables.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.950
This is priority inversion disorder classic.

00:38.960 --> 00:46.430
Left untreated, a person loses hours without realizing the high value tasks are starving.

00:46.440 --> 00:50.710
Let me walk you through the priority matrix protocol.

00:50.720 --> 00:55.310
You'll need this if you want to rewire Mia's day, and your own.

00:55.320 --> 00:59.350
Rule one: urgent is not the same as important.

00:59.360 --> 01:04.550
A meeting with no agenda, that's noise. A client report due tonight?

01:04.560 --> 01:08.350
That's fuel for your career. Learn to spot the difference.

01:08.360 --> 01:12.430
Rule two: cluster tasks into three tiers:

01:12.440 --> 01:16.710
critical ops, which is client deadlines, deliverables,

01:16.720 --> 01:23.550
commitments that move missions forward, support ops, which is progress tasks, prep work,

01:23.560 --> 01:27.510
planning the trip after critical tasks are secure.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.910
Noise ops, which is optional meetings.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.870
social pings, non-essential errands.

01:33.880 --> 01:38.790
Rule three: never start your day with noise ops, ever.

01:38.800 --> 01:42.430
You eat the biggest mac first, not the breadcumbs.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.510
Prioritization isn't about doing everything.

01:45.520 --> 01:50.590
It's about doing the important things first, and letting the rest wait their turn.

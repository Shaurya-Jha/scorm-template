00:00.160 --> 00:02.790
Detective, you're entering the chrono observatory.

00:02.800 --> 00:09.990
Don't touch anything that glows red or blue. Actually, just don't touch anything.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.070
Our subject is a Orion Flux, seasoned forecaster and a brilliant mind.

00:17.080 --> 00:22.710
Until last week, when his ability to estimate time broke down severely,

00:22.720 --> 00:26.630
he told the board he'd finish two-hour task in 30 minutes,

00:26.640 --> 00:29.910
said a five-day analysis cycle would take... one afternoon

00:31.000 --> 00:34.990
Now he's drowning in overdue work and shattered expectations.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.990
That's time compression bias.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.750
People think things will take less time than they actually do.

00:42.760 --> 00:49.070
One of the most dangerous errors in the city. These warped timelines spread like viruses.

00:49.080 --> 00:54.070
If they don't get corrected, entire departments fall into schedule chaos.

00:54.080 --> 00:59.910
You need to master planning accuracy. It's one of the pillars of time mastery. First rule.

01:00.480 --> 01:05.710
Whatever time you think a task will take, multiply it by 1.5,

01:05.720 --> 01:10.310
not because you're slow, but because the universe is messy,

01:10.320 --> 01:16.830
unexpected calls, mini emergencies, loading screens, human delays,

01:16.840 --> 01:20.230
everything takes longer in reality than in your head.

01:20.240 --> 01:24.350
Second rule: group similar tasks into single blocks,

01:24.360 --> 01:29.830
emails with emails, analysis with analysis, reviews with reviews.

01:29.910 --> 01:37.340
This reduces cognitive switching. Every switch costs time. You may not feel it, but your brain does.

01:37.360 --> 01:42.630
third rule: humans get about six hours of real productive output per day.

01:42.640 --> 01:46.430
Not eight, not ten, six.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.630
if you plan for more than that, you're not planning, you're fantasizing.

01:50.640 --> 01:56.750
and finally, buffers. insert 10 to 15 minutes between major tasks.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.910
that's your breathing room, your decompression, your...

02:00.120 --> 02:02.950
protection against unexpected delays.

02:03.090 --> 02:07.700
If you follow these rules, you will overcome your time compression bias.
